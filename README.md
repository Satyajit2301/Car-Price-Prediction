# Car-Price-Prediction
A comparative analysis of Linear and Lasso Regression applied to a car pricing dataset. It includes data preprocessing, encoding, model training, evaluation using R² scores, and visualizations to analyze the models' performance. Great for learners exploring model regularization.

# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear & Lasso Regression

This repository contains a machine learning notebook that performs price prediction of used cars based on various features using supervised regression techniques.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Predict the selling price of a car based on features such as:
- Year of purchase
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Seller Type
- Present Price, Kms Driven, etc.

## 🔧 ML Models Used
- **Linear Regression** (baseline model)
- **Lasso Regression** (adds regularization)

## 📈 Metrics & Visuals
- R² Score on train and test sets
- Visual comparison using scatter plots

## 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
jupyter notebook
